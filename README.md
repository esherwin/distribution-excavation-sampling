This is the Jupyter notebook used for this code (presented as a rich text file to strip potentially de-anonymizing metadata).
The underlying database used by this notebook cannot be disclosed due to anonymization concerns related to a non-disclosure agreement with our partner utility.

Scientists or researchers wishing to replicate the results of our study should reach out to the authors, particularly the corresponding author, Dr. Evan D. Sherwin (evands@stanford.edu) to initiate discussions related to data access with our utility partner.
